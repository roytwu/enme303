# UMBC ENME303

## Course Objective
This is an undergraduate course in linear algebra and numerical methods for students of Mechanical Engineering at UMBC. After finishing this course, students will be able to
* Solve linear equations;
* Perform matrix algebra, calculating determinants and inverses;
* Be familiar with the concept of orthogonality of vectors;
* Have solid base of understanding the concept of linear systems and the corresponding applications;
* Be comfortable with MATLAB programming.


## Schedule (alinging with the syllabus):
1. demo_vectors
2. demo_matxBasic
3. demo_orthogonality


## Archive Slides
I taught this course 5 fimes between Fall 2021 and Sring 2024. The course used to have two 50-min lecture plus one 90-min "lab" section. The lab is dedicated to MATLAB programming, and it was ran by teaching assistants (TAs), both graudate and/or undergrd students. (Strictly speaking, it is technically not a lab, as no experiments were carried out.) Each semester, the TAs would refine the slides and update the lab assignments. Starting from Fall 2024, the course setup is updated to two 75-min lectures and MATLAB programing is now taught by myself. 

Since the lab section is removed from the course. I would like to acknowledge the contributions of the teaching assistants by archiving the presentation slides.
